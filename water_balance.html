        <p class="lead">Live the life of a crab!</p>
        <p>This game simulates Dr Bliss’s discoveries about blackback land crab salinity levels to survive. She discovered that the ideal salinity level for a blackback land crab is 15%, and that above 35% is very harmful to the crab and causes the crab’s eyestalks to bulge, as the game shows. When the crab’s salinity level passes 35%, the simulator crab dies, replicating the real life of the crab.</p>
        <p>Your character is the red crab. Your goal is to beat the black crab by maintaining a salinity level of 15% and staying fed.</p>
        <p>Use the arrow keys to move around the sand dunes. To increase salinity, take a dip in the salt water pools. Stay out of the water to decrease.</p>
        <p>Keep track of your saline level through the percentage in the top left corner. To eat, go to the blades of grass around the water pools and press SPACE. The black crab likes to steal the food for himself and burrow away somewhere else, so watch out! Maintain a hunger level above 0% to stay alive!</p>
