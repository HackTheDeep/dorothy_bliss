		<h1>About Dr. Bliss</h1>

		<h2>Impact</h2>
		<p>A manifestation of Dr Bliss’s impact of others takes place in Dorothy Skinner’s paper, Proteins of the Crustacean Exoskeleton, in which she dedicates the paper to Dr Bliss. Dr Bliss’s research proved essential to many further discoveries in the crustacean field – Skinner describes Dr Bliss as having done all of the prerequisite work required to conduct further experiments on land crabs, including figuring out the ideal environment for the crab to survive. Skinner says that Dr Bliss really had a “feeling for the organism”, the organism being the blackback land crab, and her research would not have been possible without Dr Bliss. Examples like these illustrate the extent to which Dr Bliss paved the way in crustacean research, and opened doors for others despite obstacles presented by the time period she lived in.</p>
			
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>During her lifetime, Bliss faced the challenges of many women during her time period – perhaps even more challenges because science was and still is such a male dominated field. Although she went to two very good colleges, Radcliffe (Harvard’s then sister school) and Pembroke (now Brown University), she still encountered challenges. Specifically during her education, although Radcliffe was an amazing institution, many of its alumni have spoken out and said that it was obvious the majority of funds and resources were directed towards the all-male Harvard, and Radcliffe did not get many resources. The women described the Radcliffe experience as one of marginalization and patronization by lofty, snobby, others.</p>
